Pok√©mon MCP Battle ServerThis project provides a Pok√©mon battle simulator powered by the Pok√©API and the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It exposes MCP tools so that an LLM (or MCP inspector) can fetch Pok√©mon, fetch moves, start battles, and play turn-based battles with proper damage mechanics, type effectiveness, and status effects.

‚ú® Features
-Fetch Pok√©mon: Fetches data from Pok√©API with caching to avoid repeated API calls.
-Fetch Moves: Retrieves move metadata like power, type, and status effects, also with caching.
-Turn-Based Battle System: Includes a comprehensive battle system with:Damage calculation (STAB, type effectiveness, critical hits).
-Status conditions (paralysis, sleep, burn, poison, freeze).End-of-turn effects (poison/burn damage, sleep duration).
-Random Opponent: The opponent is chosen randomly from the full Pok√©dex for varied gameplay.
